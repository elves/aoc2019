# Elvish solutions to Advent of Code 2019

I started this to discover what Elvish still needs as a general-purpose
programming language. A general-purpose programming language may not necessarily
be a particular good one for Advent of Code problems, but at least it should has
all the facilities necessary for solving them.

Incidentally, since I wrote the Elvish code in the style I personally like, this
repository can also serve as an example of idiomatic Elvish programs.
